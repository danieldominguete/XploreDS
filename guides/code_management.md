# Code Management

Code management, also known as source code management (SCM), is the process of managing changes to source code, documents, and other digital content over time. It involves tracking changes, identifying versions, and maintaining a record of all modifications made to the codebase.

Effective code management is crucial for:

Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Version control: Changes can be tracked, and previous versions can be recovered if needed.
Backup and recovery: Code is safely stored, and backups can be easily restored.
Security: Access control and authentication ensure that only authorized personnel can modify the code.
Compliance: Code management helps meet regulatory requirements and industry standards.
Common code management practices include:

Version control systems (VCS): Tools like Git, SVN, and Mercurial manage changes to the codebase.
Branching and merging: Developers create separate branches for new features or bug fixes and merge them into the main codebase.
Code reviews: Peers review code changes to ensure quality, security, and adherence to standards.
Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD): Automated processes build, test, and deploy code changes.
Code organization: Code is structured and organized using folders, modules, and naming conventions.

## Guide

I apologize for the confusion, but `cz-committizen` is primarily a tool for managing commits in Git repositories. It is not specifically designed for use in Python projects.

If you are working on a Python project and want to enforce a consistent commit message format, you can use tools like `commitizen` or `conventional-commit-cli`. These tools provide similar functionality to `cz-committizen` but are designed for use in Python projects.

Here are the steps to use `commitizen` in a Python project:

1. **Installation**: Install `commitizen` in your project using pip:
   ```
   pip install commitizen
   ```

2. **Initialization**: Initialize `commitizen` in your project by running the following command in your project's root directory:
   ```
   commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact
   ```

3. **Configuration**: Add a configuration file named `commitizen.config.js` to your project's root directory. This file specifies the commit message format and other settings. Here's an example configuration using the conventional changelog format:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     path: 'cz-conventional-changelog',
     'cz-conventional-changelog': {
       preset: 'angular',
     },
   };
   ```

4. **Commit**: To make a commit, use the `cz commit` command instead of `git commit`. `commitizen` will prompt you to provide information about the commit, and generate a commit message based on the provided information.

   ```
   cz commit
   ```

   You can also use the `-m` flag to provide a commit message directly:
   ```
   cz commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
   ```

By using `commitizen` in your Python project, you can ensure that your commit messages follow a standardized format, making it easier for others to understand the changes being made.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
